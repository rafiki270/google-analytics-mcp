          ## Hints for arguments

          Here are some hints that outline the expected format and requirements
          for arguments.

          ### Hints for `dimensions`

          The `dimensions` list must consist solely of either of the following:

          1.  Standard dimensions defined in the HTML table at
              https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/api-schema#dimensions.
              These dimensions are available to *every* property.
          2.  Custom dimensions for the `property_id`. Use the
              `get_custom_dimensions_and_metrics` tool to retrieve the list of
              custom dimensions for a property.

          ### Hints for `metrics`

          The `metrics` list must consist solely of either of the following:

          1.  Standard metrics defined in the HTML table at
              https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/api-schema#metrics.
              These metrics are available to *every* property.
          2.  Custom metrics for the `property_id`. Use the
              `get_custom_dimensions_and_metrics` tool to retrieve the list of
              custom metrics for a property.


          ### Hints for `date_ranges`:
          {get_date_ranges_hints()}

          ### Hints for `dimension_filter`:
          {get_dimension_filter_hints()}

          ### Hints for `metric_filter`:
          {get_metric_filter_hints()}

          ### Hints for `order_bys`:
          {get_order_bys_hints()}

    Note that the reference docs at
    https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta
    all use camelCase field names, but field names passed to this method should
    be in snake_case since the tool is using the protocol buffers (protobuf)
    format. The protocol buffers for the Data API are available at
    https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/analytics/data/v1beta.

    Args:
        property_id: The Google Analytics property ID. Accepted formats are:
          - A number
          - A string consisting of 'properties/' followed by a number
        date_ranges: A list of date ranges
          (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/DateRange)
          to include in the report.
        dimensions: A list of dimensions to include in the report.
        metrics: A list of metrics to include in the report.
        dimension_filter: A Data API FilterExpression
          (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/FilterExpression)
          to apply to the dimensions.  Don't use this for filtering metrics. Use
          metric_filter instead. The `field_name` in a `dimension_filter` must
          be a dimension, as defined in the `get_standard_dimensions` and
          `get_dimensions` tools.
        metric_filter: A Data API FilterExpression
          (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/FilterExpression)
          to apply to the metrics.  Don't use this for filtering dimensions. Use
          dimension_filter instead. The `field_name` in a `metric_filter` must
          be a metric, as defined in the `get_standard_metrics` and
          `get_metrics` tools.
        order_bys: A list of Data API OrderBy
          (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/OrderBy)
          objects to apply to the dimensions and metrics.
        limit: The maximum number of rows to return in each response. Value must
          be a positive integer <= 250,000. Used to paginate through large
          reports, following the guide at
          https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination.
        offset: The row count of the start row. The first row is counted as row
          0. Used to paginate through large
          reports, following the guide at
          https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination.
        currency_code: The currency code to use for currency values. Must be in
          ISO4217 format, such as "AED", "USD", "JPY". If the field is empty, the
          report uses the property's default currency.
        return_property_quota: Whether to return property quota in the response.
        credentials: Optional override for the credentials used to call the
          Analytics Data API. Provide a google.auth.credentials.Credentials
          instance, a mapping/dict with service account JSON, a JSON string, or
          a path to a service account key file.
