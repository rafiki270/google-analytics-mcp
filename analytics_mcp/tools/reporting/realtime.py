          ## Hints for arguments

          Here are some hints that outline the expected format and requirements
          for arguments.

          ### Hints for `dimensions`

          The `dimensions` list must consist solely of either of the following:

          1.  Realtime standard dimensions defined in the HTML table at
              https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/realtime-api-schema#dimensions.
              These dimensions are available to *every* property.
          2.  User-scoped custom dimensions for the `property_id`. Use the
              `get_custom_dimensions_and_metrics` tool to retrieve the list of
              custom dimensions for a property, and look for the custom
              dimensions with an `apiName` that begins with "customUser:".

          ### Hints for `metrics`

          The `metrics` list must consist solely of the Realtime standard
          metrics defined in the HTML table at
          https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/realtime-api-schema#metrics.
          These metrics are available to *every* property.

          Realtime reports can't use custom metrics.

          ### Hints for `date_ranges`:
          {get_date_ranges_hints()}

          ### Hints for `dimension_filter`:
          {get_dimension_filter_hints()}

          ### Hints for `metric_filter`:
          {get_metric_filter_hints()}

          ### Hints for `order_bys`:
          {get_order_bys_hints()}

    Args:
        property_id: The Google Analytics property ID. Accepted formats are:
          - A number
          - A string consisting of 'properties/' followed by a number
        dimensions: A list of dimensions to include in the report. Dimensions must be realtime dimensions.
        metrics: A list of metrics to include in the report. Metrics must be realtime metrics.
        dimension_filter: A Data API FilterExpression
          (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/FilterExpression)
          to apply to the dimensions.  Don't use this for filtering metrics. Use
          metric_filter instead. The `field_name` in a `dimension_filter` must
          be a dimension, as defined in the `get_standard_dimensions` and
          `get_dimensions` tools.
          For more information about the expected format of this argument, see
          the `run_report_dimension_filter_hints` tool.
        metric_filter: A Data API FilterExpression
          (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/FilterExpression)
          to apply to the metrics.  Don't use this for filtering dimensions. Use
          dimension_filter instead. The `field_name` in a `metric_filter` must
          be a metric, as defined in the `get_standard_metrics` and

          For more information about the expected format of this argument, see
          the `run_report_metric_filter_hints` tool.
        order_bys: A list of Data API OrderBy
          (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/OrderBy)
          objects to apply to the dimensions and metrics.
          For more information about the expected format of this argument, see
          the `run_report_order_bys_hints` tool.
        limit: The maximum number of rows to return in each response. Value must
          be a positive integer <= 250,000. Used to paginate through large
          reports, following the guide at
          https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination.
        offset: The row count of the start row. The first row is counted as row
          0. Used to paginate through large
          reports, following the guide at
          https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination.
        return_property_quota: Whether to return realtime property quota in the response.
        credentials: Optional override for the credentials used to call the
          Analytics Data API. Provide a google.auth.credentials.Credentials
          instance, a mapping/dict with service account JSON, a JSON string, or
          a path to a service account key file.
