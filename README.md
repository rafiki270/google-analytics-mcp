This repo contains the source code for running a local
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that interacts with APIs for
[Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics).

## Tools üõ†Ô∏è

The server uses the
[Google Analytics Admin API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1)
and
[Google Analytics Data API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1)
to provide several
[Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) for use with LLMs.

### Retrieve account and property information üü†

- `get_account_summaries`: Retrieves information about the user's Google
  Analytics accounts and properties.
- `get_property_details`: Returns details about a property.
- `list_google_ads_links`: Returns a list of links to Google Ads accounts for
  a property.

### Run core reports üìô

- `run_report`: Runs a Google Analytics report using the Data API.
- `get_custom_dimensions_and_metrics`: Retrieves the custom dimensions and
  metrics for a specific property.

### Run realtime reports ‚è≥

- `run_realtime_report`: Runs a Google Analytics realtime report using the
  Data API.

## Setup instructions üîß

‚ú® Watch the [Google Analytics MCP Setup
Tutorial](https://youtu.be/nS8HLdwmVlY) on YouTube for a step-by-step
walkthrough of these instructions.

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nS8HLdwmVlY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS8HLdwmVlY)

Setup involves the following steps:

1.  Configure Python.
1.  Configure credentials for Google Analytics.
1.  Configure Gemini.

### Configure Python üêç

[Install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx).

### Enable APIs in your project ‚úÖ

[Follow the instructions](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841)
to enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud project:

* [Google Analytics Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/analyticsadmin.googleapis.com)
* [Google Analytics Data API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/analyticsdata.googleapis.com)

### Configure credentials üîë

Configure your [Application Default Credentials
(ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
Make sure the credentials are for a user with access to your Google Analytics
accounts or properties.

Credentials must include the Google Analytics read-only scope:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly
```

Check out
[Manage OAuth Clients](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257)
for how to create an OAuth client.

Here are some sample `gcloud` commands you might find useful:

- Set up ADC using user credentials and an OAuth desktop or web client after
  downloading the client JSON to `YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE`.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
    --client-id-file=YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE
  ```

- Set up ADC using service account impersonation.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --impersonate-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
  ```

When the `gcloud auth application-default` command completes, copy the
`PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` file location printed to the console in the
following message. You'll need this for the next step!

```
Credentials saved to file: [PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON]
```

#### Provide credentials dynamically per request

By default, the MCP server uses your Application Default Credentials. If you
prefer to reuse a single server instance with different Google Analytics
accounts, each tool exposed by the server now accepts an optional
`credentials` argument. Pass a service account key in any of the following
formats to override the credentials just for that request:

- A dictionary / mapping containing the service account JSON content.
- A JSON string with the contents of the service account key.
- A filesystem path pointing to a service account JSON file.

Example:

```python
await run_report(
    property_id="123456789",
    date_ranges=[{"start_date": "2025-01-01", "end_date": "2025-01-31"}],
    dimensions=["sessionSourceMedium"],
    metrics=["activeUsers"],
    credentials="/path/to/client-service-account.json",
)
```

The supplied credentials must include the
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly` scope. When no override is
provided, the server returns an error so that requests never fall back to your
application default credentials. If you really need the legacy behaviour, opt
in explicitly by setting `ANALYTICS_MCP_ALLOW_ADC=true` before launching the
server.

### Launch locally with Make üõ†Ô∏è

Start the server from the repository with:

```shell
make launch
```

If you want to allow the server to fall back to Application Default Credentials,
set `ANALYTICS_MCP_ALLOW_ADC=true` (and any other variables you need) before running the command:

```shell
ANALYTICS_MCP_ALLOW_ADC=true make launch
```

### Configure Gemini

1.  Install [Gemini
    CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/index.md)
    or [Gemini Code
    Assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist).

1.  Create or edit the file at `~/.gemini/settings.json`, adding your server
    to the `mcpServers` list.

    Replace `PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` with the path you copied in the previous
    step.

    We also recommend that you add a `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` attribute to the
    `env` object. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in the following example with the
    [project ID](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113) of your
    Google Cloud project.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "analytics-mcp": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "analytics-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON",
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Try it out ü•º

Launch Gemini Code Assist or Gemini CLI and type `/mcp`. You should see
`analytics-mcp` listed in the results.

Here are some sample prompts to get you started:

- Ask what the server can do:

  ```
  what can the analytics-mcp server do?
  ```

- Ask about a Google Analytics property

  ```
  Give me details about my Google Analytics property with 'xyz' in the name
  ```

- Prompt for analysis:

  ```
  what are the most popular events in my Google Analytics property in the last 180 days?
  ```

- Ask about signed-in users:

  ```
  were most of my users in the last 6 months logged in?
  ```

- Ask about property configuration:

  ```
  what are the custom dimensions and custom metrics in my property?
  ```
